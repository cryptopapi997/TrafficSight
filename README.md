# TrafficSight - Hackatum 2019 Project

More than 500.000 people (NIH) are blind or suffer from a sight impairing disability in Germany alone. With the advent of quiet electric cars, crossings
are more dangerous than ever for such people. This is especially the case in many rural and underdeveloped areas where traffic lights do not employ some means of speech communication. Our app aims to facilitate interacting 
with traffic for these citizens through geolocation and AI.
