# TrafficSight

More than 500.000 people (NIH) are blind or suffer from a sight impairing disability. With the advent of quiet electric cars, crossings
are more dangerous than ever such people, especially if traffic lights do not employ some means of speech communication 
with blind pedestrians, as is not only the case in many rural and underdeveloped areas. Our app aims to facilitate interacting 
with traffic for these citizens through geolocation and AI.
